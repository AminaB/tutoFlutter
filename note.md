# Notes

A body can take only one widget, but we can use column widget ( lists of widgets)

## Button

- in onPressed, place the name of the function (ex : action, not action())
- we have to use sttefull widgets when the internal data change, sttless wdgts can't re-run build() when its properties change
- setStage(()); update the widget.

## private class

- under_score at first of the name of class, method or variable turn them to private. (ex : _myapp)

## container

- we have Margin (outside the border), Border, padding(between child and border), and child(content)
- use VoidCallback, if the function do not have input and return nothing
