# Notes

A body can take only one widget, but we can use column widget ( lists of widgets)

## Button

- in onpressed, place the name of the function (ex : action, not action())
- we have to use sttefull widgets when the internal data change, sttless wdgts can't re-run build() when its properties change
- detaStage(()); update the widget.
